Kaeon ACE is a system that establishes a standard set of interfaces and features for game engines.
It provides a cross-engine file format in which a game can be encoded,
a modular model for game engine design,
and a file format that establishes a metagame across various unrelated games by amalgamating their save data.

<h2 align="center">Prerequisites</h2>

The ACE game dialect and the ACE metagame dialect are built on the ONE and ONE+ markup languages.
You can find information on ONE here:

The ACE game enigne model is built on the Philosopher's Stone concept. You can find more information on the Philosopher's Stone here:
